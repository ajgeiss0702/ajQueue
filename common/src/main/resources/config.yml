# If a player is in a server, you can have the plugin make them automatically join a queue for another server
# Example with the default values: Player joins the limbo server, they will auto-join the queue for the lobbys group
# Note that you dont have to use groups. Just put the name of a server to use a single server instead.
queue-servers:
  - 'limbo:lobbys'

# Should the plugin send an actionbar to the player?
# The actionbar contains some info such as which server they are queued for, what position they are in, estimated time remaining, etc.
send-actionbar: true

# What kick reasons should cause the player to be removed from the queue?
# For example, if one of the below kick reasons is 'banned' and the player gets kicked when trying to connect to
#  a server in a queue with a message saying "You are banned from this server!" then it will kick them from the queue too.
kick-reasons:
  - 'banned'
  - 'blacklisted'


# Should we remove a player from the queue if they move servers?
# This will remove the player from if they switch to any other server
#  Default: false
remove-player-on-server-switch: false


# Should we wait until the server is done loading to load the servers?
# Enable this if you have a plugin that adds servers to the server list during startup.
#  Default: false
wait-to-load-servers: false

# How long should we wait after the server finishes loading to load the server list?
# Only works if the above is enabled.
# This is in miliseconds so 1000 = 1 second

# This will show players a different name than the actual bungeecord server name
# for example, instead of showing players "event-a", this option can make it appear as "Event A"
# With this example, you would use this: - "event-a:Event A"
# Note that currently players still have to use the normal names in queue commands and leave commands
#  Format: "realname:Alias"
server-aliases:
  - "event-a:Event A"


# How long should we wait after a server is online before sending players?
# The server will still show up as offline or restarting until this amount of time after its up
# Meant to let your server 'cool down' after lag from starting up
# In seconds
#  Default: 1
wait-after-online: 1


# This is for helping with finding issues with the server pinged
# This will spam the console when enabled
# When this enabled, if servers are offline then it will spam errors. You can ignore them.

# Server groups are a group of servers that you can queue for. It will send you to the server that is the least full.

# Should we allow tab-completing in the /queue command?

tab-complete-queues: true

# Should we have no wait time for these servers?
# If the server is joinable, the plugin will attempt to send players who join these queues as soon as they join.
# If the server is not immidiatly joinable, they will have to wait for the normal wait-time
# This also works with group
# NOTE: Server names are caps sensitive

# so you should probably only use this for debugging purposes

# When a player is kicked from a server, should we automatically add that player to the queue?
# You will still need to use another plugin to make sure the player doesnt get kicked from bungee completly.

auto-add-to-queue-on-kick: false
# The delay for the above option.
# In seconds, decimals supported.
#  Default: 1
auto-add-to-queue-on-kick-delay: 1

# With what kick reasons should we auto-add the player to the queue
# This wont work if auto-add-to-queue-on-kick is disabled.
# If you set it to [], then all kick messages will cause the player to be added to the queue
# This works on contains, so you dont have to include the whole kick message, just a few words.
auto-add-kick-reasons:
  - "restarting"
  - "closed"

# Should we enable the server command being a queue command?

# What priority should we give whitelisted players priority when the server is whitelisted?
