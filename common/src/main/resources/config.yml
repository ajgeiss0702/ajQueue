# Should we act like servers a player doesn't have permission for doesn't exist?
# So if a player doesn't have permission to queue for a server, and they try to queue for it,

# This option does nothing if require-permission is disabled.
# IMO this is pointless, but people keep asking for it so here you go...
#  Default: false

# Should we enable the ajqueue.bypasspaused permission?
# If enabled, anyone with the permission ajqueue.bypasspaused will be able to join paused servers
#  Default: false

# What kick reasons should cause the player to be removed from the queue?
# This works on contains, so you only need to include a word or two from the kick message.
# For example, if one of the below kick reasons is 'banned' and the player gets kicked when trying to connect to
#  a server in a queue with a message saying "You are banned from this server!" then it will kick them from the queue too.
kick-reasons:
  - 'banned'

#  default - Will send the player to the server in the group with the least number of players

# Should we enable the server command being a queue command?

# What servers should we make slash server commands for?
# For example, if survival is in this list, then if a player executes /survival
#  then they will be put in the queue for survival
# This works for both servers and groups
# If you have ajQueuePlus, you can also make aliases.
#  For example, if you have a server called lobby, and you want people to be able to use /hub, you can use this:

#  If you have the free version, you can only put the server name, no aliases.

# Should we wait until the server is done loading to load the servers?

wait-to-load-servers: false

# How long should we wait after the server finishes loading to load the server list?

# Should we have no wait time for these servers?
# If the server is joinable, the plugin will attempt to send players who join these queues as soon as they join.

# This also works with group
# NOTE: Server names are caps sensitive
send-instantly:

# Should we require permissions for queue-servers to work?

# Example: lobby-1,lobby-2,lobby-3:754,755,756
#  This example will only allow 1.16.5, 1.17, and 1.17.1 on the 3 lobby servers
# Note that this will only restrict queues.
#  If you go around the queue (e.g., using the default /server command), then this will not apply

# Should the updater be enabled?

plus-level-fallback: false

# How many send times should we keep track of for calculating ETAs?
# The time between players being sent to the server is averaged to get the ETA.
# This amount of "time between sends" will be used in that average.
# Increasing this will result in a more stable ETA, but will take longer to update for big changes in send times.
