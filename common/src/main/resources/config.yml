# The time the server will wait between sending people in the queue
#  Default: 5
wait-time: 5.0

# The time that a server has to be offline to be marked as offline instead of restarting
#  Default: 120
offline-time: 120

# The time the server will wait between sending players update messages on what position they are in the queue.
# Default: 10

# If a player is in a server, you can have the plugin make them automatically join a queue for another server
# Example with the default values: Player joins the limbo server, they will auto-join the queue for the lobbys group
# Note that you dont have to use groups. Just put the name of a server to use a single server instead.
queue-servers:
  - 'limbo:lobbys'

# Should the plugin send an actionbar to the player?
# The actionbar contains some info such as which server they are queued for, what position they are in, estimated time remaining, etc.
send-actionbar: true

# What kick reasons should cause the player to be removed from the queue?
# For example, if one of the below kick reasons is 'banned' and the player gets kicked when trying to connect to
#  a server in a queue with a message saying "You are banned from this server!" then it will kick them from the queue too.
kick-reasons:
  - 'banned'
  - 'blacklisted'

# Should we completly kick the user from the server if they are in a queue-server
#  and are kicked from the server with one of the above reasons?
# Note this will do nothing on servers that arent queue-servers
#  (as in the config option queue-servers)
#  Default: true
kick-kicked-players: true

# Should we remove a player from the queue if they move servers?
# This will remove the player from if they switch to any other server
#  Default: false
remove-player-on-server-switch: false


# Should we wait until the server is done loading to load the servers?
# Enable this if you have a plugin that adds servers to the server list during startup.
#  Default: false

# How long should we wait after the server finishes loading to load the server list?
# Only works if the above is enabled.
# This is in miliseconds so 1000 = 1 second
#  Default: 500
wait-to-load-servers-delay: 500


# How often (in seconds) we should check for new servers to add queues for.
# If you dynamicly add servers, set this to something other than 0.
# To disable, set to 0

# This will show players a different name than the actual proxy server name
# for example, instead of showing players "event-a", this option can make it appear as "Event A"
# With this example, you would use this: - "event-a:Event A"
# Note that currently players still have to use the normal names in queue commands and leave commands
#  Format: "realname:Alias"
server-aliases:
  - "event-a:Event A"


# How long should we wait after a server is online before sending players?
# The server will still show up as offline or restarting until this amount of time after its up
# Meant to let your server 'cool down' after lag from starting up
# In seconds
#  Default: 1
wait-after-online: 1


# This is for helping with finding issues with the server pinged
# This will spam the console when enabled
# When this enabled, if servers are offline then it will spam errors. You can ignore them.

# Server groups are a group of servers that you can queue for. It will send you to the server that is the least full.

# Should we have no wait time for these servers?
# If the server is joinable, the plugin will attempt to send players who join these queues as soon as they join.

# This also works with group
# NOTE: Server names are caps sensitive
send-instantly:
  - "lobbys"

# Should we log to the proxy console when a player fails to get sent to a server from the queue?
# Enable this if you are having an issue with one player stopping the queue

# The delay for the above option.
# In seconds, decimals supported.
#  Default: 1
auto-add-to-queue-on-kick-delay: 1

# With what kick reasons should we auto-add the player to the queue
# This wont work if auto-add-to-queue-on-kick is disabled.
# If you set it to [], then all kick messages will cause the player to be added to the queue
# This works on contains, so you dont have to include the whole kick message, just a few words.
auto-add-kick-reasons:
  - "restarting"
  - "closed"

# Should we enable the server command being a queue command?
# This may require extra setup on bungeecord. See the wiki:

# Should we enable priority messages?
# Configure the priority messages in the option below.

# What protocols do servers support?
# The protocol version number list can be found here: https://wiki.vg/Protocol_version_numbers
# Format: server(s):protocol(s)
# Example: 1.17:755,756
#  This example will only allow 1.17 and 1.17.1 on the server called 1.17
# Example: lobby-1,lobby-2,lobby-3:754,755,756
#  This example will only allow 1.16.5, 1.17, and 1.17.1 on the 3 lobby servers

# Should the updater be enabled?
enable-updater: true

# What servers should we make slash server commands for?
# For example, if survival is in this list, then if a player executes /survival
#  then they will be put in the queue for survival
# This works for both servers and groups
# If you have ajQueuePlus, you can also make aliases.
#  For example, if you have a server called lobby, and you want people to be able to use /hub, you can use this:
#   - "hub:lobby"
#  If you have the free version, you can only put the server name, no aliases.
slash-servers: []

# What balancer should we use?
# If a group is not specified here, then the default one is used
# Example entry: - "bedwars:minigame"
# Balancers:
#  default - Will send the player to the server in the group with the least number of players
#  minigame - Will send the player to the server with the most players, until that server is full, which it will then send to the next server
balancer-types:
  - "bedwars:minigame"

# What priority should we give whitelisted players priority when the server is whitelisted?

# What priority should we give players that are able to bypass paused priority when the server is paused?
