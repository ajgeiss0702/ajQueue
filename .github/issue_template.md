!!!   READ BEFORE CREATING A GITHUB ISSUE   !!!

GitHub Issues are no the place to get support. Before creating an issue, make sure you have talked to aj and agree that it is appropriate for a GitHub Issue.

Even if you are sure it is an issue with the plugin, it could still be a configuration issue.

GitHub Issues that have not been seen by aj before opening (and are not strictly related to development) will be closed with the message "this is not the place to get support"
